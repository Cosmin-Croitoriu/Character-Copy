  "description": "Javascript Kata using Jest\r ```The Kata\r     In the interest of better understanding NSubstitute, write a character copier class that reads characters from a\r source and copies them to a destination. It must copy and write one character at a time.\r     To do this create a Copier class that takes in a ISource and IDestination. ISource has one method char ReadChar() and\r IDestination has one method void WriteChar(char c). The Copier class has one method void Copy() that when called\r reads from the ISource one character at a time and write to IDestination as seen in Figure 1 below.\r     The copying and writing is done character at a time until a newline (‘\\n’) is encountered. Then the processing stops\r without writing the newline. Only the Copier class may exist as a concrete. You are to use NSubstitute to implement\r ISource and IDestination.",
